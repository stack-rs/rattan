# Tests

Check integration tests on the `integration/` subdirectory.
Check external tests on the `exploration/` subdirectory. All external tests must be **ignored** by default. External tests are minimal runnable code snippets validating the functionalities of external APIs (third-party libraries and OS). External tests validate our belief in external APIs and record our knowledge of them.
